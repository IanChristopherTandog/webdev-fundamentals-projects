# WebDev Fundamentals Projects

This repository contains all my foundational web development projects, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript exercises. These projects come from various learning platforms such as Roadmap.sh, YouTube tutorials, and personal practice.

Each project is self-contained in its own folder and includes:
- A clear file structure  
- A short project description  
- A live preview URL (GitHub Pages) when applicable
